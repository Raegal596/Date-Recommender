      "faithfulness_reasoning": "All recommended venues and their specific details are directly supported by the search context. Liuyishou Hotpot is confirmed as an authentic spicy spot; The Hexagon Board Game Cafe is correctly located on Whyte Ave with mentions of strategy games and espresso; Fairmont Hotel Macdonald Spa is accurately described with side-by-side massages and saline pools; Nosh Cafe's location on 109 St and its 'Best Chai' claim are in the text; Il Poom's unique induction tables and Yukgaejang are verified; and Kind Ice Cream in Ritchie is confirmed to have Mint Chip and seasonal rotations.",
      "relevance_score": 5,
      "relevance_reasoning": "The agent perfectly aligned the recommendations with the user profile. It captured Mandy's specific favorite ice cream flavor (Mint Chip), her love for Yukgaejang and spicy food, their shared interest in board games (mentioning Hanabi specifically), and their mutual need for physical recovery due to Pilates and running. The choices are geographically appropriate for Edmonton and seasonally appropriate for a cold February day."
